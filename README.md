[JetClient](https://jetclient.io) is a simple and powerful API
client plugin for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, PyCharm, PhpStorm, etc.).
It combines the best features of existing API clients with additional enhancements, all within your IDE.
Key features include:

- **File Sync (Git Sync)**: Stores requests and folders in a human-readable format on your file system, enabling easy
  sharing and collaboration with your team via Git.
- **Environment Groups**: Create environment groups to select multiple environments at once. For example, one group
  for (dev, test, prod) and another for (user, admin).
- **Convenient Variable Management**: Variables are defined in JSON5 format and organized into two editors: shared (
  synced) and local (non-synced). Variables can include not only primitive types but also objects and arrays.
- **Powerful Scripting**: Write pre-request and test scripts for requests and folders. Additionally, create test suite
  scripts that can reuse existing requests, eliminating the need to duplicate them.
- **Integration with Source Code and OpenAPI**: Import APIs directly from your source code, and effortlessly navigate
  between requests and the corresponding code, and vice versa.
- **GraphQL Support**: Integrates seamlessly with JetBrains' GraphQL plugin for syntax highlighting and code completion.
